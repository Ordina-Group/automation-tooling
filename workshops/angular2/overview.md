Angular 2: A new world ?
A story to tell in 2 sessions.


1. Session 1 (3 October 2016)
    * Part 1:
        * Angular-cli with out of the box wiring and generators
        * Pro and Cons
        * Brocolli vs ...
        * Generators
        * Wiring for reload, unit & E2E testing //Auto generated wiring for testing with small example with TTD (unit)
        * Exercise: Create angular 2 project (guided & commentary) (add extra  npm packages e.g. angular material, sass loading)   //@Ryan:  from scratch  not from our project

    * Part 2:
        * Intro in Angular 2 (Why Angular2, current state, core concepts)
        * Components (maybe vs directives)  (pipes here as well ?)
            * Theory
        * NgModules (maybe vs directives)
            * Theory
        * Exercise: Implement ngModule and a Component (Checkout or generate / Write basic unit test / Implement ngModule and a Component  and run)
        * Services (& observables)
            * Theory (Unit Testing http calls with mockbackend   and observables ?)
            * Exercise: Implement service (Checkout or generate / Write basic unit test / Implement service and run)

2. Session 2 (10 October 2016)
    * Part 1:
        * Router
            * Theory
            * Exercise  Implement a router (Checkout or generate / Write basic unit test / Implement the router and run)
        * Reactive forms vs template driven forms
            * Theory (2 way binding...)
            * Exercise: Implement a basic form. (Checkout or generate / Write basic unit test / Implement the router and run)

        * SOMETHING ELSE ??? // tot hier hebben we dan alles wat je wilt vertellen over de theory   en steeds ook unit testing het nieuwe 'element' in code)

    * Part 2:
        * Angular 2 E2E testing with protractor
            * Theory about E2E and page objects and how (tools) we can do this.
            * Wiring in the app (tests and pageobjects)
            * Example showing
            * Exercise: Implement a few E2E tests (app wide) TBD

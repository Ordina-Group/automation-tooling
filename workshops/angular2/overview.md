A story to tell in 2 sessions.


1. Session 1 (3 October 2016)
    * Part 1:
        * Angular-cli with out of the box wiring and generators
        * Pro and Cons
        * Brocolli vs ...
        * Generators
        * Wiring for reload, unit & E2E testing
        * Exercise: Create angular 2 project

        * Part 2:
            * Intro to Angular2
                * Why Angular2?
                * Current state
                * Core concepts(Dependency Injection, Data binding, Components)
                * Decorators and metadata
            * Components, directives and pipes
                * Components vs directives
                * Component architecture, unidirectional data flow vs n-way data binding
                * Pipes
            * NgModules
                * What are NgModules
                * @NgModule metadata properties
                * AoT vs JIT Compiling

        * Exercise: Implement ngModule and a Component (Checkout or generate / Write basic unit test / Implement ngModule and a Component  and run)
        * Services (& observables)
            * Quick intro to Reactive Programming and Observables
            * Providers and dependencies
                        * Unit Testing http calls with mockbackend  and observables
            * Exercise: Implement service (Checkout or generate / Write basic unit test / Implement service and run)

2. Session 2 (10 October 2016)
    * Part 1:
        * Router
            * Theory
            * Exercise  Implement a router (Checkout or generate / Write basic unit test / Implement the router and run)
        * Forms
            * Reactive forms vs template driven forms
            * Form Validation
            * Exercise: Implement a basic form. (Checkout or generate / Write basic unit test / Implement the router and run)

    * Part 2:
        * Angular 2 E2E testing with protractor
            * Theory about E2E and page objects and how (tools) we can do this.
            * Wiring in the app (tests and pageobjects)
            * Example showing
            * Exercise: Implement a few E2E tests (app wide) TBD
